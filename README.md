This is a custom user CSS style that improves scaling in the 2004scape client by:

* Scaling up the client to fill more of the browser's viewport.
* Preserving pixel-perfect integer scaling (MORE INFO BELOW)
* Hiding the banner in order to provide more space for the client.

In order to achieve pixel-perfect scaling, you MUST click "Auto scaling" beneath the client in order to switch to "Pixel scaling" mode. If you do not do this, the client will appear blurry!

I am personally using the "Stylus" plugin for Firefox, but this should work with any of the various user style plugins for various browsers.
