This is a custom userscript for Tampermonkey that improves scaling in the 2004scape client by:

* Scaling up the client to fill more of the browser's viewport.
* Preserving pixel-perfect integer scaling (MORE INFO BELOW)
* Hiding the banner and control bar in order to provide more space for the client.

Installation:
* Navigate to the dashboard of Tampermonkey.
* Paste "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UbelBrandt/2004scale/refs/heads/main/2004scale.js" (without quotes) into the "Import from URL" box.
* Click "Install".
